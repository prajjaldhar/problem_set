### LeetCode Problem Collection for Beginners
👋 Hey everyone! I’m Prajjal Dhar, and I’ve created this LeetCode problem list to help beginners start their DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) journey with structured and categorized problems. 💡

I know how overwhelming it can be to decide where to start and which problems to solve first—so this list is designed to guide you step by step! 🚀

### 🎯 Who is this for?
This list is perfect for:
✅ Absolute beginners starting with LeetCode.
✅ Students looking for a structured problem-solving roadmap.
✅ Job seekers preparing for coding interviews.
✅ DSA learners who want to improve problem-solving skills.

### 📌 How to Use This List?
This list is structured by topic, so you can go step by step:

- 1️⃣ Start with Arrays & Strings (Easy problems).
- 2️⃣ Move on to Binary Search & Sorting for problem-solving logic.
- 3️⃣ Practice Linked Lists for pointers and memory management.
- 4️⃣ Try Stacks & Queues for LIFO/FIFO-based problems.
- 5️⃣ Learn Trees & Binary Search Trees for recursive thinking.
- 6️⃣ Explore Graphs and Dynamic Programming for advanced problems.

### Each problem is linked to LeetCode, so you can directly open & practice! 🔗
